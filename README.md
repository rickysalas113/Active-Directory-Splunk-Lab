# Splunk Lab

## Objective

The Active Directory/Splunk project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system (Splunk). The lab also included Kali Linux as our attacking machine, and Atomic Red Team, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of how machines send data to Splunk, also what to look for while investigating.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Ability to install Splunk and have it up and running with users.
- Create an Active Directory from scratch with organizational units and users.
- Installed Splunk forwarder with Sysmon on my user machine.
- Understanding of Atomic Red Team and what kind of telemetry it sends to the SIEM.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- MITRE ATT&CK framework, such as Atomic Red Team, which provides small, easily executable tests that mimic adversary tactics. This allows organizations to identify vulnerabilities and enhance their defenses.
- Crowbar, which is a brute-forcing tool in Kali Linux used to crack password-protected services like SSH, VNC, RDP, and openVPN.

## Screenshots of my work

- Here I am on my Splunk server setting a static IP of 192.168.10.10/24.

- I am able to reach Splunk at 192.168.10.10:8000 (Splunk listens on port 8000).

- Here I am Installing Splunk Forwarder onto my target machine.

- I have successfully installed sysmon as well.

- These are instructions for my Splunk Forwarder to push events related to Application, Security, System, and Sysmon over to my Splunk Server.

- The following shows the index "Endpoint". This is where events happening on the machine will be sent too

- Using the Tool Crowbar on Kali to brute-force into one of the users I created in my domain. As you can see it was successful.

- On my Splunk server you can see that there were 4 Event Codes generated. Event code #4625 indicated failed log ons. This is significant because it showed that 1 out of the 21 passwords worked. Event code #4624 indicated a successful log on to a user account.

- Diving deeper into the investigation we can see the network information of the attacker. My workstation Kali and source IP address 192.168.10.250
